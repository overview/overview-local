#
# This domain name and associated "-plugin-" domain names must all be registered

# Maximum number of documents per document set.

# Most of Overview's features scale to millions of documents. Some, like
# tagging, are noticeably slow when applied to over 10,000 documents at once.
OV_MAX_DOCUMENTS=2000000

# Maximum number of characters per document. (The rest will be truncated.)
#
# Be careful when increasing this, as you may run out of RAM. Multiply this
# number of characters by the product of the following:
#
# * One character can cost 4 bytes (and costs minimally 2 bytes).
# * Sending bytes over the network copies them -- multiply by 2.
# * [worker only] The worker can ingest batches of 100 documents.
# * [web only] The web server can stream batches of 20 documents.
# * [web only] The web server handles concurrent requests -- 10 isn't unusual.
#
# Product: worker 800x; web 1600x. In other words: if you limit each document
# to 1,000,000 characters, those documents can cost 800MB RAM on the worker and
# 1.6GB on the web server -- in addition to all the other memory being used.
#
# This limit is only checked during ingest. Once a document is ingested, the
# web server will serve it even if it is over the limit.
